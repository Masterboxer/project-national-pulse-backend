# 📘 User API - Usage Guide

This API provides basic CRUD operations for managing users in the system.

## 📍 Base URL

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Make sure your server is running on this address. Adjust the port if needed.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Go server must be running with the endpoints correctly wired.
- PostgreSQL database must be up and reachable.
- Users table should exist with columns: `id`, `name`, `email`.

---

## 💪 Run with Docker

To run the application and PostgreSQL database using Docker:

### 1. Ensure the following files are in your project root:

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`

### 2. Build and start the containers:

```bash
sudo docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the Go app container (`national-pulse-app`)
- Start a PostgreSQL container (`national_pulse_db`) with database `pulse`
- Expose the API on port `8000`

### 2.5. If Postgres file path is needed to be added temporarily

```
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin"
```

### 3. API Access

Once running, the API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You can now use the cURL commands above to test the endpoints.

---

## 📌 Notes

- All responses are in JSON format.
- No authentication is currently implemented.
- Make sure to use unique emails when creating users if your database has a unique constraint on the `email` field.
